# Contributing to HTML as Custom Elements

## Developing

First, get set up. Ensure you have Chrome Canary installed, then run

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then, you can run the tests via either

```bash
$ npm test
```

for a single run, or

```bash
$ npm watch
```

for continuous development. In both cases, a Chrome Canary tab will pop open, and report the results back to your console.
